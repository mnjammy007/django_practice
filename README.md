## What is the use of .env.example

```
I can not showcase my EMAIL_HOST_USER and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD to everyone,
so I have created a .env file, which is not tracked by git.
.env.example is the file which contains the variables like .env without values, which are needed to run the project.
use python dotennv module to load the variables from .env file.
